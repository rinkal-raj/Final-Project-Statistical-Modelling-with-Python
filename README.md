# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The projectâ€™s main goal is to collect data from different APIs like CITY BIKE API, FOURSQUARE API & YELP API.
To analyze data which collect from various APIs & clean data to remove duplicates and irrelevant values & make data more sensible and useful.
Then, create data visualization which helps understand data in the easiest way.
Generate regression model which is the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable.


## Process
### (step 1 :: USE VARIOUS APIS)
Collect data of city bike stations from city bike APIS and also collect data for restaurants and Bar for same locations of bike stations.

### (step 2 :: Data Analysis and Data Cleaning)
In Data Analysis, Analyze data and check whether we got appropriate data or not and check each value in the data set.      
In Data Cleaning, Remove Duplicate values from data.  Remove Null values
        Remove Irrelevant column.
        And make data more precise and accurate which helps us to get proper data results

### (Step 3 :: Data Visualization)
In this process, data display in graphs and charts which helps user to understand data easily.
I created histogram,heatmap and many more which help to undestand data easily

### (Step 4 :: Model Building)
Create regression model which is the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable.
The model is not good fit because R square of the model is too low and the p-value is zero so that in the model output shows the effect of each variable is too low on outcome.


## Results

 I was first to select the city was Velobike-Moscow but this dataset has not accurate and proper data then after I select the city was Chicago. The city has many number of data but the data was too messy and duplicated.
 The regression model is not a good fit for the data because the R-square value is too low and no more relation between variables.



## Challenges 
(1) Extract data from APIs.
(2) Difficult to store API key in the environment.
(3) When I deleted duplicate data from Data Frame I lost many rows of data.
(4) When I merge data, I got too complicated data
(5) Model Building I did not get proper Output.


## Future Goals
 If I have time I properly analyze data and try to understand data and I will do with better with visualization and modeling.
